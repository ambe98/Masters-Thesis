# Masters Thesis - Relaxation process of Yukawa glassy system

As part of my master thesis in Applied Physics and Mathematics at NTNU, I studied the relaxation process of a binary colloidal Yukawa system in a glassy state using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. All trajectories of the particles in the system were calculated using a software called LAMMPS. This repository includes most of the code used in post-processing of the data gathered from the MD simulations. Thus, the notebooks include code for calculating the static structure factor, intermediate scattering function and a method for clustering the mobile particles using k-means. Further, some code is also directed to the visualization of these methods and the colloidal system itself. 

Note that the codes were primarily written for self-use and can therefore appear messy and uncommented. Optimization of the code was only conducted in time-consuming computations. In addition, the output files from the MD simulation were in a size order that prevented them for being included in this repository. The output files can however be reproduced using inspiration from the included input-files and the thesis itself. 

In addition to the thesis, the pre-study work: "Characterization of ordered and disordered systems using
molecular dynamics, 2021" is also included.
